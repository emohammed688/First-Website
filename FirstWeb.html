<h3> About me </h3>
<p class ="low"> Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Esam Mohammed and I am a 20 year old college student from Niles IL. Born and raised in Chicago for most of my life, I attended elementary school in the North West side of the city up until 2009. In 2009 I left the U.S and went on to live in Jordan for about four years. In 2013 I returned back to the U.S and finished high school at Maine East High school in Park ridge IL. After completing high school I enrolled in my local community college to fulfill my general education requirements. My plan is to enroll at Depaul University this up coming fall to pursue a degree in Computer Science.</p>

<h3 > Why Web Development </h3>
<p class = "high"> Throughout my first year in college, I was unsure on what I wanted to major in or what I enjoyed doing. While I did not know what I wanted to do, I knew it had to be something I was passionate about. I spent the first year taking different classes just to see what I was interested in, but nothing caught my attention. It was not until my second year of school where I took my first CS class that I finally decided that I wanted to further my education in Computer science. Although my ultimate goal is to work in artificial intelligence, I believe web-development is the first step towards achieving that goal.

<h3> Hobbies </h3>
<p class ="medium"> As a full-time employee and a full-time student I have very little free time. Outside of school and work, I spend my free time either hanging out in the city with my friends or catching up on my favorite T.V shows. Some of these shows include shameless,the 100 and community. Last year I made the decision to  travel at least once a year.</p>
